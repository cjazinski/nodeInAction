This will follow the Node.js in Action book.

Some of the stuff is just random examples. I've added a new folder for that

** Important **

Some of the stuff in the book doesn't work with the newer versions of the modules. I noticed I had to use
formidable when the book did not. I looked it up and the bodyParser for files was being depreciated. So It might not follow
book exactly.. But It should accomplish the same examples.. Just with updated syntax or modules.
